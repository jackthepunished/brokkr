# Phase 5 — Consensus & HA

- **Status:** in progress
- **Plan:** `docs/plan.md` §17
- **Started:** 2026-07-02

Goal: replace the single-node embedded metadata store with a **from-scratch
Raft** implementation (CLAUDE.md rule 10 — no external Raft crate), then stand
up a highly-available control plane on top of it. This is the educational
centerpiece of the project. This journal accumulates a short retrospective per
increment.

**Definition of done** (`docs/plan.md` §17): kill the leader → new leader in
< 2 s; partition the cluster → minority stops accepting writes, rejoin →
consistent; 1M operations under fault injection with zero divergence.

**Milestone map** (one PR each, in order): I0 paper notes · I1 ADR 0013 +
`brokkr-raft` scaffold · I2 persistent state on redb · I3 leader election ·
I4 log replication + Figure-8 test · I5 turmoil simulation suite · I6 snapshots
+ InstallSnapshot · I7 joint-consensus membership · I8 Raft-backed KV in
`brokkr-control` + leader redirect · I9 3-node HA + Jepsen-style harness ·
I10 wrap-up + §11 exit-criteria review.

## I0 — Raft paper notes (§17 task 1)

- **Date:** 2026-07-02
- **Affected:** docs only (`docs/raft-notes.md`).
- **Outcome:** `docs/raft-notes.md` — the implementation reference for
  `brokkr-raft`, taken from the extended Raft paper (Ongaro & Ousterhout, 2014)
  and the relevant thesis chapters. Covers the three server states and terms as
  a logical clock; the persistent (`currentTerm`, `votedFor`, `log`) vs. volatile
  state split and the **persist-before-respond** rule; leader election with
  randomized 150–300 ms timeouts; the RequestVote and AppendEntries RPCs step by
  step; the `(lastLogTerm, lastLogIndex)` election restriction; log repair via
  `nextIndex` back-off with conflict-only truncation; snapshots + InstallSnapshot;
  joint-consensus membership; client linearizability with a dedup session cache;
  and the five safety properties.

### Decisions / notes

- **The Figure-8 rule gets top billing (§7 of the notes).** The naive
  "committed once on a majority" rule is unsafe for entries from prior terms;
  the leader commit-advance must gate on `log[N].term == currentTerm`. This is
  the one subtlety most likely to pass casual testing and silently lose data, so
  the notes pin a **deterministic Figure-8 regression test** as a hard
  requirement for milestone I4.
- **Determinism is designed in from I0.** The notes require an **injected clock
  and injected seeded RNG** in the state machine (no `SystemTime::now()`),
  matching `docs/plan.md` §21, so the `turmoil` simulation suite (I5) is
  reproducible from a fixed seed.
- **redb reuse is already blessed.** ADR 0003 anticipated this phase: "the
  snapshot format becomes the redb file at log index N." I6's snapshot design
  will build on that rather than invent a new on-disk format.
- **Everything traces to a milestone.** The notes end with an implementation
  checklist keyed to I1–I9 and a DoD-to-mechanism table, so each later increment
  has an unambiguous spec to test against.

### Next

- **I1:** ADR 0013 (Raft design — transport, log schema, newtypes) for owner
  sign-off, then scaffold the `brokkr-raft` crate (Transport trait + tonic &
  turmoil impls, redb log schema, `Term`/`LogIndex`/`NodeId` newtypes). The ADR
  needs explicit owner approval **before** any implementation.
